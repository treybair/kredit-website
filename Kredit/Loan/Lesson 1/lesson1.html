                    <p>Overview</p>
                    So you got schooled on credit cards. Feeling confident? Good! They are the first step to building up those financial muscles (#gainz) to really get money-swole later. Let&#39;s dive in and help you know other ways you can get this super money lending magic (just kidding, not magic. We wish). 

                    <br><br>So different types of credit are called Lines of Credit. We already talked about credit cards. The other line of credit you will run into most often are loans. Loans come in lots of different shapes and sizes (long term, short term, big amount, small amount, high interest rate, low interest rate), but the basics stay the same. Remember how credit card payments change every month? With loans, the payment will stay basically the same every month until is paid off.

                    <br><br>You are given money. You spent it. You pay it back with interest. 

                    <br><br>See? Super simple process! All of the variables will change, but the idea stays the same. So let&#39;s lay it out in real life for a bit.

                    <br><br>So, you turned 16 and your grandparents gave you $3,000 for a car. Super sweet, right? But here&#39;s the deal, cars cost WAY more than $3,000. So you&#39;re shopping and you find the perfect ride, but is $5,000. Two GRAND more than you have. What do you do?

                    <br><br>You take out a loan. 

                    <br><br>Loans are like credit card payments, but instead of having a new balance every month, you divide the big sum into smaller and more manageable chunks. 

                    <br><br>So you get a loan for $2,000. The loan term is 2 years, which means you have 24 months (and 24 payments) to pay the whole thing back. You negotiate and you get a 10% interest rate. 

                    <br><br>Your monthly payment will be $92.29. Over the course of 24 months, you&#39;ll pay $2214.96, or $214.96 in interest. 

                    <br><br>So every month for the next two years you have to pay $92.29 toward you car. Each time you make your payment, you are closer and closer to paying off your debt. After two years, you own your car and are sitting pretty! Good work! 

                    <br><br>When you figure out the terms for a loan (like the interest rate or the length of loan), you have to be careful to make sure you can make the monthly payment. The longer the loan, the lower the monthly payment. But here&#39;s the catch: you&#39;ll usually pay more in interest over a longer loan even if the interest rate is lower. Don&#39;t believe me? Watch.

                    <br><br>$2,000 loan	24 month loan 	@ 	10% interest = 	$214.96 in interest payments
                     <br>       $92.29 monthly payment 	x 24 months  = 	$2,214.96

                    <br><br>$2,000 loan	6 month loan 		@ 	20% interest = 	$118.28 in interest payments
                     <br>       $353.05 mostly payment	x 6 months = 		$2,118.27

                    <br><br>Let&#39;s take a look at those two options. Option 1: You may less per month, more in interest, and a little more over time. Option 2: You pay a lot more per month, less in interest, and pay it off faster. But, can you swing that nearly $400 payment every single month? Probably not. In that case, it would be smarter to take smaller payments that you KNOW you can cover rather than overextending yourself and promising to pay more than you can afford. 

                    <br><br>It&#39;s important to find a good balance of a manageable monthly payments (something you&#39;re sure you can pay off every month) with the ability to pay it off as quickly as possible to reduce the amount of interest you pay over the term of the loan. 

                    <br><br>There is one thing to be especially careful about with loans. Loan offers may come in for way more money than you need. If you go in looking for a $2,000 loan, you may “qualify” for a $4,000 loan. That means these loan people found a way to give you more money than you asked for if you seem like you&#39;d be able to pay it back (we&#39;ll talk more about how they figure this out in the credit score section). They may look at your income (or your parents&#39; income) and think you can fork out more each month. But they don&#39;t really know, do they? They want you to borrow as much as they think they can get back so they can rake in the bigger interest payments. (Remember, interest is based on your balance. So if you borrow $4,000 your interest payment will be TWICE as much as if you borrow $2,000. Yowza). 

                    <br><br>So don’t take more than you need. Pop Quiz: Remember the whole “living within your means/staying within your budget/whatever you want to call it” lesson from budgeting? It means don&#39;t spend more money than you have. Don&#39;t take on bigger payments that you do not need. Sure, that probably means you won&#39;t have a sports car for your first ride. #Bummer. But, that also means you will have more money to save every month and spend on fun stuff than you would have. #Winning
